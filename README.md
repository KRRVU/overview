# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning group, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

The [KR&R group](https://krr.cs.vu.nl) investigates modelling and representation of different forms of knowledge and reasoning, as found in a large variety of AI systems. We study both theoretical and applied aspects of knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) formalisms, and try to apply these ideas to both scientific and real-world problems. From its early days on, our group has played an active role in the development of Semantic Web technologies. Also recently, we have broadened our focus to a wide-spectrum of problems in which KRR formalisms can help with: from neuro-symbolic AI to medicine and health care but also to collaborative multi-agent systems. These are also the elements of our research on Hybrid Intelligence (HI) which aims to combine human and machine intelligence. It is a long-term large scale project shared between 6 partner universities, headquartered by our group, and is funded by a 10 year Zwaartekracht grant from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.
